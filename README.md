# ShowHost

## Project Overview

'ShowHost' is an application that lists upcoming gigs in the user's local area. 

Users can search for upcoming gigs by genre, name, or date, and can then 'attend' shows which saves the show to the user's list.
 
        
### Description
Problem - 

More so than ever concertgoers are presented with a plethora of gigs to attend, but sometimes too much choice can be a bad thing.
